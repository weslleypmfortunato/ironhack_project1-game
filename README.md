This is the famous hangman game where the user chooses a group of words, the computer randomly chooses a word from this group and the user uses a virtual keyboard to type the letters that can be part of the chosen word.
The user can choose up to 5 letters that are not part of the word. On the sixth incorrect choice, he kills his partner, the doll.

There are versions in English and Portuguese. Test your knowledge and help save your doll's life.
